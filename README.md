Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory. Install the packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

   After the installation is complete, start Jupyter Notebook with:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will open a new tab in your web browser where you can create and manage your Jupyter notebooks.
